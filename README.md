# **Project Resume: EKS Disaster Recovery Implementation**

### **Objective**

Design and implement a **cross-region Disaster Recovery (DR) strategy** for an existing EKS-based production environment. The goal is to ensure **minimal downtime and data loss** in the event of a regional failure by enabling automated restoration of workloads, data, and infrastructure in a secondary AWS region.

### **Scope**

* Backup and replication of Kubernetes resources and EBS volumes.
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment of a standby EKS cluster in a secondary region.
* Restore orchestration for both infrastructure and applications.
* Validation through automated or manual DR simulation tests.

### **Current Environment**

* **Primary Region Tools**:

  * EKS, EBS, S3, EFS
  * AWS Backup
  * AWS DataSync
  * Kubernetes-native workloads

* **Current DR Approach**:

  * Single-region backup using AWS Backup and DataSync
  * No automated cross-region failover or cluster recovery


Now let's go through it.

## 1. Epic Name

> **"Implementation of Cross-Region Disaster Recovery Strategy for EKS Workloads"**


## 2. Acceptance Criteria

* All persistent volumes (EBS) are backed up and replicated to another AWS region at least once per day.
* Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, etc.) are exported, versioned, and restorable in a secondary EKS cluster.
* A script or pipeline is available to rebuild a fully functional cluster in another region, including secrets, volumes, and network configurations.
* A documented procedure for disaster simulation testing is implemented and validated.
* The entire process can be triggered via CI/CD or manually.

* **AWS Backup**: for EBS and RDS volumes
* **Velero**: for Kubernetes-native backups (ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVCs, etc.)
* **S3 cross-region replication**: to sync backups to the failover region
* **Terraform/Helm**: for infrastructure-as-code and automation

## 4. EKS Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy 

### Overview
This project implements a cross-region Disaster Recovery (DR) solution for Kubernetes workloads hosted on Amazon EKS. The design ensures that in case of a regional outage, critical workloads and data can be restored in a secondary AWS region.

### a. Backup & Replication
- **Velero**: Backup and restore Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes.
- **AWS Backup**: Schedule and manage EBS volume backups.
- **S3 with cross-region replication**: Store Velero backups and replicate them to the target region.

### b. Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Provision EKS clusters and related infrastructure in the secondary region.

### c. DR Orchestration
- **GitHub Actions / Jenkins Pipelines**: Trigger automated failover and restore operations.

## 5. Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Velero in Primary Region
```bash
velero install \
  --provider aws \
  --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.7.0 \
  --bucket eks-velero-backup \
  --backup-location-config region=us-east-1 \
  --snapshot-location-config region=us-east-1 \
  --secret-file ./velero-credentials-aws
```

### Step 2: Schedule Daily Backups
```bash
velero create schedule daily-backup \
  --schedule="0 1 * * *" \
  --include-namespaces my-app \
  --ttl 168h
```

### Step 3: Enable S3 Cross-Region Replication
Use a replication rule in the S3 bucket settings to replicate Velero backups to the secondary region.

### Step 4: Terraform Deployment in Secondary Region
Provision standby infrastructure (see `terraform/` folder).

### Step 5: Restore in Secondary Region
```bash
velero restore create --from-backup daily-backup-2025-07-01-01-00
```

## 6. Files Included
- `scripts/restore-test.sh`: Script to simulate and test recovery.
- `terraform/`: Contains Terraform modules to deploy EKS and supporting resources.
- `.github/workflows/failover.yml`: GitHub Actions pipeline to trigger DR restoration.

## 7. Testing the DR Plan
Use the script and pipeline provided to:
- Delete a namespace or simulate outage
- Restore the namespace from Velero backups in another region
- Validate application health and data integrity

## Conclusion

You have been through  our disaster recovery (DR) plan, we created a setup that protects our EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) environment in case something goes wrong in one AWS region. We use an active-passive strategy, which means the main cluster runs in Region A, and a second (standby) cluster is ready in Region B.

To back up our applications and data, we use Velero, a tool that saves Kubernetes resources and storage (like EBS volumes). These backups are stored in an S3 bucket, and AWS automatically copies them to the second region. This way, we always have a copy of everything, even if one region fails.

We use Terraform to define and manage the infrastructure in both regions. This means we can quickly and reliably create or rebuild the standby environment when needed. To make recovery easier and faster, weâ€™ve set up a GitHub Actions pipeline. This pipeline helps automate the process of setting up the standby environment, restoring data, and bringing the applications back online.

Overall, this setup helps us reduce downtime and data loss. It also makes it easier to test our disaster recovery plan regularly, so we know it works when we really need it.
